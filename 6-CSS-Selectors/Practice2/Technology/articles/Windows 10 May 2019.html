                <p>Windows 10’s next update is the May 2019 Update, which is version 1903 and was codenamed 19H1 during
                    development. It features a light theme, speed improvements, and lots of polish. There are no crazy
                    new features like My People or Timeline. This article includes everything new as of Insider Preview
                    build 18362.30, released on April 4, 2019. Microsoft previously called this Windows 10’s April 2019
                    Update, but it was delayed. The update will spend time in the “Release Preview” ring being tested
                    before a stable release later in May.</p>
                <p><b>Big Changes to Windows Update</b></p>
                <p>Microsoft announced it’s making big changes to the way Windows 10 updates. You’ll have much more
                    control over the way Windows 10 installs updates—or not. Specifically, Windows 10 will no longer
                    automatically install big updates like the May 2019 Update and October 2018 Update every six months
                    without your permission. Now, you’ll see a notification and it’s your choice when you want to
                    install the update. Don’t want to install the update? That’s fine. You can keep using your current
                    version of Windows 10 for as long as it’s supported with security updates—that’s 18 months after
                    release. But, once every 18 months, you will be forced to update to keep getting security fixes.
                    This is much better than once every six months, and it gives you a lot more control. On top of that,
                    Microsoft will now let Home users pause updates—just as Professional users can—for up to 35 days.
                    You must pause in seven day periods, but you can pause up to five times. And, after you check for
                    updates in Windows Update, Windows won’t automatically install them—you’ll have a choice to pause
                    the updates, if you like.</p>
