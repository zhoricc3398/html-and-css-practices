            <h1>Robert Wadlow: Tallest man ever</h1>

                <p>"The only admissible evidence upon the true height of giants is that of recent date made under
                    impartial medical supervision." These were the words of Norris and Ross McWhirter, the founders of
                    Guinness World Records, in 1955. They went on to dismiss claims for legendary giants such as the
                    biblical Og, King of Bashan (allegedly 9 Assyrian cubits, or 494.03 cm/16 ft 2.5 in tall), citing
                    "confusion of units". The twins then named Robert Wadlow as the tallest man "of whom there is
                    irrefutable evidence". When last measured on 27 June 1940, the mild-mannered American stretched a
                    staggering 2.72 m (8 ft 11.1 in) tall. Perhaps surprisingly, Robert entered the world no differently
                    to most babies. He was born on 22 February 1918 to two regular-sized parents, weighing an
                    unremarkable 3.85 kg (8.7 lb). But he rapidly started to shoot up, reaching an incredible 1.63 m (5
                    ft 4 in) by the age of five, by which time he was already wearing clothes intended for teenagers.

                <p><b>Toddler in teenager's clothing</b></p>
                <p>Aged eight, he overtook his 5-ft 11-in-tall (180.3-cm) tall father, Harold F Wadlow, and towered over
                    his four younger siblings. When most children were still being carried by their parents, Robert was
                    able to lift his father up the stairs of their family home. Robert’s incredible height caused a
                    number of medical issues however, which worsened as he grew older – and taller. Yet as a young boy,
                    he tried his hardest to get involved in the same activities his peers were doing. For example, he
                    became a Boy Scout at the age of 13, and had a customised uniform, tent and sleeping bag. Robert
                    passed the 2.45 m (8 ft 0.5 in) mark by the age of 17, making him – unsurprisingly – the tallest
                    teenager ever. In 1936, the gentle giant graduated from high school and enrolled in college with the
                    intention of studying law.</p>
                <p><b>Wadlow's death</b></p>
                <p>Sadly, it was Robert's legs that caused his premature death, aged just 22 years old. He died at 1:30
                    a.m. on 15 July 1940 in a hotel in Manistee, Michigan, as a result of a septic blister on his right
                    ankle caused by a brace, which had been poorly fitted only a week earlier. His last words were "The
                    doctor says I won't get home for the...celebrations", a reference to his paternal grandparents'
                    golden wedding. The Alton Giant was then buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Alton, in an enormous coffin
                    measuring 3.28 m (10 ft 9 in) long, 81 cm (32 in) wide and 76 cm (30 in) deep.</p>
                <p><b>Legacy</b></p>
                <p>In 1986, a life-size statue of Wadlow was erected on College Avenue in Alton, opposite the Alton
                    Museum of History and Art, in honour of the city's most famous resident. There are also a number of
                    real-size models of him in a variety of museums across the world. His influence has even stretched
                    into the music world: in 2005, American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens recorded a track titled
                    "The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders", about Wadlow's life.</p>
