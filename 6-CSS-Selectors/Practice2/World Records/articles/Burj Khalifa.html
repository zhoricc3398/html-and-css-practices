            <h1>Burj Khalifa: The tallest building in the world</h1>

                <p>In March 1996 the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, overtook the Sears Tower's record as the
                    world's Tallest office building. Stainless steel pinnacles 73.5 metres (241 ft) long placed atop the
                    88-storey towers brought their height to 451.9 metres (1,482 ft 8 in). Then, in 2003, Taiwan’s
                    Taipei 101 (also known as the Taipei Financial Centre) took the title at a huge 508 metres (1,666
                    ft). Just one year later, construction on the Burj Khalifa began. It was to form part of a new 2 km2
                    (490-acre) flagship development called Downtown Dubai at the 'First Interchange', near Dubai's main
                    business district in the UAE. The towering property was developed by Emaar Properties and the
                    architects Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, headed up by renowned American architect, Adrian Smith.
                    Reaching a breath-taking 828 m (2,716 ft 6 in) into the sky, this new skyscraper would soon be
                    described as a ‘vertical city’ and become an icon of the modern world. </p>
                <p><b>Design and construction</b></p>
                <p>All over the globe, people were asking whether it was even possible to construct a building that high
                    – and that was when the Burj was designed to be 'just' 518 metres tall, 10 metres taller than the
                    Taipei. It actually grew by a whopping 310 metres during the design process – aproximately the
                    height of the Eiffel Tower in France. Construction began on 21 September 2004, with the exterior of
                    the structure completed on 1 October 2009. The taller a building is the greater the effects of
                    weather, but the neo-Futurist-style Burj Khalifa was designed with a complex Y-shaped cross section
                    to reduce the effect of wind. Everything about the Burj is superlative and involves huge numbers:
                    there were more than 12,000 people from all over the world who worked on the construction of the
                    Burj Khalifa. Almost 26,000 hand-cut glass panels were used in the exterior cladding of the
                    building, which has residential, office and hotel use. It takes about three months to clean the
                    structre from the top to the bottom! The individual stalks that rise out around the central spire
                    deflect most wind around the building. Chief structural engineer Bill Baker calls it 'confusing the
                    wind'. The monumental edifice officially opened on 4 January 2010 and was certified as the Tallest
                    building on the planet. "It’s a very impressive building with a very unique design," said Talal
                    Omar, Country Manager of UAE, Guinness World Records, on announcing the record."</p>
