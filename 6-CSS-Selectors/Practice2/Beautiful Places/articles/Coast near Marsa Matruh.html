                <p>Mersa Matruh is a major Egyptian tourist resort and serves as a getaway resort for Europeans as well
                    as Cairenes eager to flee the capital in the sweltering summer months. It is served by Mersa Matruh
                    Airport. The city is known for its white soft sands and calm transparent waters. Marsa Matruh is a
                    cool attraction for beach lovers. It has become a destination for millions of tourists. The beach
                    there is too good. Sugar sand, crystal clear blue water that has a coolness to it during the most
                    hot months of the year. However, not much coral or underwater activities there. No doubt its one of
                    the most beautiful places to visit once in lifetime.</p>
