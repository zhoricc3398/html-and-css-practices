                <p>This beautiful avenue of beech trees was planted by the Stuart family in the eighteenth century. The
                    Dark Hedges is one of the most photographed natural phenomena in Northern Ireland and a popular
                    attraction for tourists from across the world. It was intended as a compelling landscape feature to
                    impress visitors.This beautiful tree tunel has been used to film a scene in HBO’s popular television
                    series Game of Thrones. Since that the Dark Hedges became so popular, and that’s why we included it
                    “top most beautiful places to visit before you die! In addition, the Dark Hedges have also been used
                    in the 2017 Transformers film The Last Knight.</p>
