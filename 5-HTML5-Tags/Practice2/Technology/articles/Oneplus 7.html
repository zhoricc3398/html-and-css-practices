                <p>The OnePlus 7 launch is edging ever closer, with more and more details about the upcoming handset (or
                    is that handsets?) appearing online. We've rounded up all the OnePlus 7 leaks below, to give you an
                    idea of what you can expect from the firm's next flagship handset, which will compete with the best
                    smartphones – and especially the best Android smartphones – coming out in 2019. OnePlus has even
                    told us one core feature about its next handset, the OnePlus 7 will likely be one of the first
                    phones to support 5G. But it may not arrive on its own, with rumors pointing to a OnePlus 7 Pro as
                    well as the standard OnePlus 7.</p>
                <p><b>Cut to the chase</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>What is it?</b> The next numbered phone from OnePlus</li>
                    <li><b></b>When is it out?</b> Possibly May 14</li>
                    <li><b>What will it cost?</b>Probably at least $549 / £499 / AU$599</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>OnePlus 7 news and rumors</b></p>
                <p>We've seen numerous images seemingly showing the OnePlus 7, with the clearest look coming from the
                    renders below, which show an almost bezel-free screen with a pop-up selfie camera, while the back
                    has a triple-lens camera. You can also see this design in some renders from a case-maker. The pop-up
                    selfie camera isn't visible, but a cut-out in the cases to make space for it is. These images can be
                    seen below. That same design was suggested in leaked photos too, some of which show an all-screen
                    design with no visible selfie camera, and one of which shows a raised section slightly above the
                    screen, which could be part of the mechanism for a slide-out camera. Since then we've seen other
                    photos, but thesesupposedly show the 'OnePlus 7 Pro' which according to another source is one of
                    three upcoming models - the other two being the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro
                    5G. The photos of the OnePlus 7 Pro can be seen below, showing a curved screen and no top bezel. The
                    images also list the phone as having a 6.67-inch screen, a Snapdragon 855 chipset, 8GB of RAM, 256GB
                    of storage, and three cameras, with 48MP, 16MP and 8MP lenses.</p>
