                <p>The PS4 has been a part of our gaming lives for over five years now, cementing itself as a historic
                    console with plentiful stellar exclusives only available on the platform. But soon, it will need to
                    step aside and make room for Sony’s new generation of hardware. Now, some official information has
                    finally been unveiled for PS5, raising our excitement levels to fever pitch.</p>
                <p><b>PS5 latest news – Sony to skip E3 2019</b></p>
                <p>Sony isn’t going to appear at E3 2019. The PlayStation giant has been present at the landmark event
                    since it began back in 1995, cementing itself as a veteran with a robust annual catalogue to
                    showcase. It remains unknown whether Sony will hold its own bespoke event or a livestream of sorts
                    around the event, taking a Nintendo Direct-esque approach to proceedings. We could see the PS5
                    unveiled 2019, potentially setting the stage for a PS5 vs Xbox Two showdown at E3 2020.</p>
                <p><b>PS5 release date – When is the PlayStation 5 coming out?</b></p>
                <p>Sony has ruled out a 2019 release for the PS5, saving its energy for a blockbuster 2020 release.
                    However, will they aim for a launch earlier in the year or once again capitalise on the competitive
                    festive period like they’ve done with previous consoles?</p>
                <p><b>PS5 Specs – How powerful will the PlayStation 5 be?</b></p>
                <p>Speaking to Wired, system architect Mark Cerny detailed some of the major specifications for its next
                    generation console. For starters, it will boast an advanced AMD Ryzen processor alongside a GPU with
                    AMD Navi architecture capable of ray tracing, a feature currently only available in high-end gaming
                    rigs. It will also support 8K graphics, although whether or not this will be upscaled remains
                    unknown. The PS5 (or whatever Sony ends up calling it) will be compatible with the current version
                    of PlayStation VR, and no plans have been announced for a successor to launch alongside the new
                    console. In terms of memory, it will feature a specialised HDD of sorts that will allow games and
                    processes to load up to 19 times faster than previous consoles. When it comes to the Xbox Two,
                    rumours have been going around about two unique models under the codename Xbox Scarlett. One is a
                    more powerful piece of tech in-line with Sony’s vision for the PS5, while the other will apparently
                    be a smaller, cheaper console with a deeper focus on streaming. This will no doubt take advantage of
                    Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Play Anywhere.</p>
