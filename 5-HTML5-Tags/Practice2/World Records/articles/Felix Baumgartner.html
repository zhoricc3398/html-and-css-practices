            <h1>Felix Baumgartner: First person to break sound barrier in freefall</h1>

            <article>
                <p>Five years in scrupulous planning, the $20-million (£12.45-million) Red Bull Stratos project made
                    history that day, signalling a huge leap forward in the world’s knowledge about the way the body
                    copes with extreme conditions near space. At 9:28 a.m. local time (3:28 p.m. GMT), Felix lifted off
                    from Roswell, New Mexico, USA. Destination: the edge of space. Within the next few hours, Felix
                    would be back on Earth having become the First human to break the sound barrier in freefall,
                    completed the Highest freefall parachute jump (38,969.4 m / 127,852 ft) and achieved the Fastest
                    speed in freefall (1,357.6 km/h / 843.6 mph). 84-year-old Joseph aided Felix throughout the mission
                    and was his main point of contact during the record-breaking jump. It took years of unthinkably
                    expensive research, development and testing with industry experts to perfect the equipment. One of
                    the most important factors for the jump was Felix’s pressure suit, because if this failed he would
                    almost certainly die. Felix hated the restrictive suit that was designed for him so much that a
                    psychologist was brought in to help him come to terms with being inside it. By the time of the
                    mission’s dramatic climax, however, every conceivable chance of a mistake or failure had been ironed
                    out. </p>
                <p><b>Largest balloon with a human on board</b></p>
                <p>A giant balloon, as tall as the Statue of Liberty when fully inflated and with a capacity of
                    approximately 850,000 m³ (30 million cu ft), carried Felix inside a capsule to an altitude of
                    38,969.4 m (127,852 ft). The balloon had around 5,097 m³ (180,000 cu ft) of helium inserted by the
                    crew prior to its launch. This was enough helium for lift off, but did not fill the balloon envelope
                    to capacity because they needed to leave space to allow the helium to expand while the balloon rose.
                    As the air pressure decreased with the balloon's rising altitude, the helium inside it expanded,
                    eventually filling the entire envelope to its full capacity of approximately 850,000 m³ (30 million
                    ft³) at jump altitude. The helium-filled balloon took Felix on his two-hour journey into the
                    stratosphere. he danger of the event was emphasised by the fact that the "live" broadcast had a
                    built-in delay, allowing the public to be spared a gruesome spectacle in the event of tragedy. After
                    the long tension-building ascent, Felix could be heard running through the checklist with Col and
                    telling of the unexpected fogging of his visor. This issue was resolved quickly.</p>
