                <p>Since the inception of the Guinness World Records book back in 1955, kids and adults from all overthe
                    globe have loved finding out about our planet’s most amazing animals.From Himmy, who was recognised
                    back in 1986 as the fattest cat in the world (a title Guinness WorldRecords no longer monitors), to
                    Medusa, who earned fame in 2011 as the Longest snake ever incaptivity, record-breaking animals
                    rarely fail to capture the interest of the publichuman tunnel travelled through by a skateboarding
                    dog, gliding through the legs of 30 people.As required by Guinness World Records, each person
                    creating the tunnel stood facing the samedirection and with their feet apart to allow the talented
                    English Bulldog to pass freely underneathwithout being led or touched in any way.A huge crowd
                    gathered to watch and the three-year-old dog became an instant celebrity, as videos ofthe
                    achievement were viewed by millions of people and news outlets all over the world.</p>
                <p><b>Inspiration</b></p>
                <p>Otto’s journey first began when his owners-to-be Luciana Viale and Robert Rickards saw the
                    renownedvideos of Tillman, the former fastest dog on a skateboard who sadly passed away in 2015.They
                    saw Tillman’s talent and were inspired to get a Bulldog of their own.It wasn’t long before the
                    adorable puppy was performing all kinds of tricks, surfing, playingfootball and, of course,
                    skating.One day, when Luciana and Otto were playing together, she saw her dog skateboarding towards
                    her sofast that she had to open her legs for him to speed through without hitting her.This is how
                    Luciana first conjured up the idea to attempt the human tunnel record.Interestingly, Otto is not the
                    only skateboarding Bulldog in his family – he also lives with hisbest friend Lola, and they do
                    everything together.uciana and Robert told Guinness World Records they are incredibly grateful for
                    all the wonderfulfriends they have made through their extraordinary Otto.</p>
